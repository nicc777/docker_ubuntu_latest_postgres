# PostgreSQL as a Docker Services on Ubuntu Image (Latest)

This repository contains a Dockerfile to attempt to always have an up-to-date method of building an image with the latest Ubuntu version and PostgreSQL database server from the official Ubuntu repository.

It is based on the example from https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/postgresql_service/

It is work on progress and mostly for myself to learn more about Docker.
